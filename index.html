<h2>Welcome to my website! </h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Christopher. I'm 25 years old and from Ocala, Florida. This website was created as part of my Web Design Principles class at the University of Florida. Currently, I have a career in digital communications, but I am also pursuing a career in writing and directing for film and television.</p>
<p> Here is what I hope to learn in this course:</p>
<ol>
<li> How to read and write computer code. </li>
<li> How to develop original websites.</li>
</ol>

<p> Ultimately, these skills will help serve me in the digital industry by expanding my knowledge and allowing me to efficiently produce online without the use of a third-party.</p>
